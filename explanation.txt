How the program works

Import necessary modules: Tkinter is used for creating the graphical user interface, pandas is used for data manipulation 
(especially for handling the Excel file), and tkinter.font is used to configure the default font size.

Initialize variables and define functions: An empty list form_data is initialized, which will later store all the data entered through 
the form. The submit and export_to_excel functions are defined, as well as functions to create additional windows (Toplevel) for 
selecting colors and sizes.

Create the main Tkinter window: A new Tkinter window (root) is created, its geometry and title are set, and its columns 
are configured. The default font size is also set here.

Create input fields: A LabelFrame (a frame with a title) is created to hold the input fields. The fields are created with 
pairs of Label and Entry widgets (or Text for the description), and laid out in the LabelFrame using the grid geometry manager.

Create color and size selection buttons: Buttons are created that open new windows where the user can select multiple 
colors and sizes. The selected options are stored in the color_vars and size_vars lists, which contain StringVar objects, 
one for each possible color or size. The StringVar objects store either the color/size (if selected) or an empty string (if not selected).

Create dropdown menus: Dropdown menus (technically OptionMenu widgets) are created for the default color and whether the 
product is downloadable. The selected options are stored in StringVar objects (default_color_var and downloadable_var).

Create submit and export buttons: Two buttons are created in another frame, one to submit the form and one to export the data. 
When the submit button is clicked, the submit function collects the data from all input fields, stores it in a dictionary 
(row_data), and appends the dictionary to form_data. The input fields are then cleared. When the export button is clicked, 
the export_to_excel function opens the existing Excel file (or creates a new one if it doesn't exist), appends the new data 
from form_data to the existing data, writes the data back to the Excel file, and clears form_data.

Run the Tkinter event loop: Finally, the mainloop method of root is called to start the Tkinter event loop, 
which waits for events (such as button clicks) and reacts to them.

So the overall flow of the program is: user fills out form -> user clicks submit -> data is stored in 
form_data and form is cleared -> user clicks export -> data is saved to Excel file and form_data is cleared. 
This process can be repeated any number of times.
